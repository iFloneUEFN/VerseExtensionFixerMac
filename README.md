**Verse for macOS** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to improve compatibility and fix key issues related to Epic Games' Verse programming language on macOS. With a few essential tweaks, you can run the **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** using **CrossOver** on Mac.

# üö® Before You Install

Please **read this carefully** to ensure the extension works as expected.

* If the extension doesn‚Äôt seem to work, or you encounter an issue, check the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iFlone.verse-extension-fixer&ssr=false#qna) before reaching out.
* Ensure **UEFN** and the **Epic Games official extensions** are up to date ‚Äî especially **after each update**.
* You must have **Visual Studio Code (Windows version)** installed inside your UEFN bottle. See the [FAQ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iFlone.verse-extension-fixer&ssr=false#qna) for cleanup instructions (some folders may need to be deleted).
* This extension **only works on macOS**. Don‚Äôt attempt to use it on Windows ‚Äî UEFN already handles this natively on that bloated platform.

# üîß System Requirements

* `brew` must be installed:

  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

* `code` command (VS Code CLI) must be installed:

  ```bash
  brew install --cask visual-studio-code
  ```

* The **Verse `.vsix` extension from Epic Games** must be installed inside the UEFN bottle.

> ‚ö† **Important:** This extension assumes specific default paths. Modifying workspace structures, assets, or digests may cause unexpected behavior. If you're unsure, avoid altering those files.

# üìÅ Expected Folder Structure

Ensure your environment resembles the following layout:

* **Fortnite Projects (auto-generated by UEFN):**
  `/Users/<yourname>/Documents/Fortnite Projects/`

* **Fortnite Install Folder (via Heroic/CrossOver):**
  `/Users/<yourname>/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/<yourbottlename>/drive_c/Program Files/Fortnite`

* **Verse Project Files (auto-generated by UEFN):**
  `/Users/<yourname>/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/<yourbottlename>/drive_c/users/crossover/AppData/Local/UnrealEditorFortnite/Saved/VerseProject/`
